The program considers the composite form of a numerical integration method for solving differential equations and does the dynamic analysis of a 3-DOF spring-mass system using this method. Calculation of the displacements, velocities, and accelerations for the second and third masses with two different stiffness values for the first spring (k1 = 5 and k1 = 10^7) have been performed. This is done for the duration from 0 to 30 seconds with a time step of 0.25 seconds. The calculations incorporate two sets of beta parameters (β1 and β2, with β2 being twice of β1). The given matrix equation, which includes mass and stiffness matrices along with displacement vectors, is provided to facilitate these calculations.
